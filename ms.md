# Micro Services 

- Small autonomous services that work together 
- Loosely coupled services 
- New technology & process adoption is easier 
- Faster release cycle 
- Scaling with cloud

# Challengs 

- Quick setup needed 
- Automation 
- Visibility 
- Bounded Context 
- Configuration Management 


# Monolith Application 

- released once every few months
- wide range of features and functionality 
- more peoples will be working on it 
- debugging is big challenge 
- bringing new technology and new process is not easy

# Application architecture  

- Monolithic Architecture
- MicroService Architecture

# Decomposition 

- Decompose by business Capability 
- Decompose by subdomain

# MicroService Architecture

- loosely coupled components
- Componets can be developed and deployed independently 
- Each component can have its own database 
- Each microservice is relatively small 

- Pros :
  - Contionous delivery 
  - Better testability 
  - Better deployability 
  - Easier for developer to undernstand 
  - More productive 
  - Improved fault isolation ( if one service is bad, still other services can continue processing. but in monolithic, it will bring down the entire system) 
  - easy to adopt to new technology and new process 
  
- Cons : 
  - Additional complexity to build the distributed system 
  - Deployment complexity
  - Increased memory consumption
